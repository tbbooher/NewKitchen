NewKitchen
==========

# Purpose

Build a functional and beautiful kitchen for a family of 7 (four kids + three adults). We know we are not trendsetters, but want a modern, nice look that is easy to clean and use.

# Overall style

Looking for an efficient design that allows for my wife to watch kids while cooking. Like the colonial style. Tend to be fans of Pottery Barn. 

Things we like:
- carrera marble
- subway tile
- shaker style cabinetry
- clean, happy and light colors (mostly white)
- restoration hardware, pottery barn
